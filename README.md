# Original Readme:
Rolls on the [Net Libram of Random Magical Effects v2.0](https://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv2.pdf), a giant random table with 10,000 different magical effects. I wanted to use this for my DnD campaign, but it was too much of a hassle to use the PDF.

# Changes I made:
Added [Net Libram of Random Magical Effects v1.2](https://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv12.pdf) to the list of possible effects to expand the possible effects by another 10,000. Version 1.2 effects are 00000-09999, verion 2 effects are 10000-19999.
